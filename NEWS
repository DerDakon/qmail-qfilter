Changes in version 1.4

- Added a new "drop message" exit code -- if the filter exits with code
  99, qmail-qfilter immediately exits successfully without calling
  qmail-queue.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.3

- A new environment variable, "QMAILRCPTS" is set to a newline-seperated
  list of the recipients.  Note that if a large number of recipients are
  encountered (ex more than 64KB worth under Linux), this will cause
  execution of the filters to fail and the message will be rejected.  I
  consider this acceptable, since 64KB worth of recipients is likely
  more than 1000 anyways.
- Removed some GNU-specific constructs from the source and Makefile.
- Included a sample MIME filename extension scanning filter.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.2

- Fixed a couple of minor bugs in error return codes in run_filters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.1

- Fixed a bug in building the linked list of commands to run.
