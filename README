qmail-qfilter
qmail-queue multi-filter front end
Bruce Guenter <bruceg@em.ca>
Version 1.2
April 26, 2000

This program allows the body of a message to be filtered through a
series of filters before being passed to the real qmail-queue program,
and injected into the qmail queue.

Requirements:

- This program is designed to take advantage of my QMAILQUEUE patch,
  which causes programs that would execute qmail-queue (such as
  qmail-smtpd etc.) to execute an alternative program.

How to install:

- Check the definitions at the top of qmail-qfilter.c, especially the
  value of TMPDIR.  This should be set to a temporary directory that
  only the executor of qmail-qfilter has write access to.
- Check the Makefile for appropriate values for your compiler and
  linker, and installation paths.
- Run "make"

How to use:

- Create a script containing an invocation of qmail-qfilter.  For
  example, a script that uses qmail-inject as a front end to qmail-queue
  would contain:
	#!/bin/sh
	exec /path/to/qmail-qfilter /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject -n
- Set the environment variable QMAILQUEUE to the location of this
  script.  For example, in a SMTP rules files, put:
	A.B.C.D:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",QMAILQUEUE="/usr/local/bin/qmail-qftest"
  and rebuild the SMTP CDB file.
- You're all set!  In our example, all messages sent from the IP A.B.C.D
  will have their content filtered through qmail-inject, which will add
  missing "From:", "Date:", and "Message-Id:" headers.

Changes in version 1.2:
- Fixed a couple of minor bugs in error return codes in run_filters.

Changes in version 1.1:
- Fixed a bug in building the linked list of commands to run.
